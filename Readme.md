# Formigas Project Code Styles
For now, let's just agree to use the default code styles provided by our preferred IDEs.
## Intellij IDEA
Go to Preferences -> Editor -> Code Style -> Scheme -> Project -> Restore Defaults
## Visual Studio Code
Use Cmd+Shift+P -> "Preferences: Open Settings (JSON)". Check what is overridden in the file.
## TODOs / Ideas
* Add instructions for more IDEs
* Introduce hooks (pre-commit, etc...) for autoformatting, etc...
* Add exported code styles from IDEs here for easier import
* Once we add custom settings that differ from the defaults, we need to export the configuration to this repo for everyone to import
* Maybe make use of Intellij Settings Repository (https://www.jetbrains.com/help/idea/sharing-your-ide-settings.html#settings-repository)
